My name is Nicholas Argentieri, I am a Senior Computer science student, 
I have taken Assembly Language, Language Processing, Software Engineering, 
Object Oriented Programming, and Computer Science 1-3. In my Software Engineering class with Professor
Zuckerman, me and 4 other people made a program that allowed data to be inputted to and accessed 
from a sqlite "database".

In the future I see that what we learn in this course will likely be very important,
as you said in class, not necessarily the specific frameworks we will be using but the concept 
of creating a modern website as a whole. Web development is a massive field and is likely going to 
be something that many of us will go on to use in our careers at some point at least.
